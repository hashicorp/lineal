Lineal is a template-first data visualization toolkit for Ember. Instead of offering components for common chart types, Lineal offers components for assembling any visualization based on a grammar of graphics, including marks, encodings, scales, and (eventually) transforms.

## Compatibility

* Ember.js v3.24 or above
* Embroider or ember-auto-import v2

## Getting Started

Right now, the best way to get started is to read through the [Dev Logs](/docs/dev-logs/a-dev-log-one) to get a feel for the features and the design decisions behind them. After that, refer to the [API Reference](/tsdocs/) to get details on component arguments and helper classes.
