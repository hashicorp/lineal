Lineal is a template-first data visualization toolkit for Ember. Instead of offering components for common chart types, Lineal offers components for assembling any visualization based on a grammar of graphics, including marks, encodings, scales, and (eventually) transforms.

## Compatibility

- Ember.js v4.x or above
- Vite-based Ember (recommended) or Embroider

## Getting Started

Right now, the best way to get started is to read through the [Dev Logs](/dev-logs/one) to get a feel for the features and the design decisions behind them. After that, refer to the [Concepts](/concepts/scales) section for details on scales, marks, and other building blocks.
