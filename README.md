# Lineal

Lineal is a template-first data visualization toolkit for Ember. Instead of offering components for common chart types, Lineal offers components for assembling any visualization based on a grammar of graphics, including marks, encodings, scales, and (eventually) transforms.

## Compatibility

* Ember.js v3.24 or above
* Embroider or ember-auto-import v2

## Install

```shell-session
ember install @lineal-viz/lineal
```
